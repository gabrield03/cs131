    4  mkdir Assignment3/
    5  touch Assignment3/Assignment3.txt


Task 1) Understand what the "last" command does. Move all lines that contain 'f23' to a new file called lastf23.fake.
   Get the number of lines in last.fake before filtering, move the lines to lastf23.fake, and get the number of lines in lastf23.fake 
   after filtering everything that does not have 'f23'
    6  last
    7  wc -l last.fake
    8  awk '/f23/' last.fake > lastf23.fake
    9  wc -l lastf23.fake


Task 2) Find all usernames who logged in on Sunday from the lastf23.fake file
   10  grep "Sun" downloadedFiles/lastf23.fake | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort | uniq | awk 'BEGIN { print "The list of people who worked on Sunday are:" } { print } END { print "Kudos to these people for putting in the work" }' >> Assignment3/Assignment3.txt


Task 3) Find all usernames who logged in between 11PM and 4AM (inclusive)
   11  awk '$7 >= "23:00" || $7 <= "04:00" { print $1 }' downloadedfiles/lastf23.fake | sort | uniq | awk 'BEGIN { print "Night Owls List:" } { print $1 } END { print "Night Owls are dope. Please ensure you get enough sleep though." }' >> Assignment3/assignment3.txt


Task 4) Find all usernames who logged in between 5AM and 9AM (inclusive)
   12  awk '$7 >= "05:00" && $7 <= "09:00" { print $1 }' downloadedFiles/lastf23.fake | sort | uniq | awk 'BEGIN { print "Early Birds List:" } { print } END { print "Early Birds are dope. Please ensure you get enough sleep though." }' >> Assignment3/Assignment3.txt


Task 5) Display all users that have a username that starts with "t" from the lastf23.fake file
   13  awk '/^t/ { print $1 }' downloadedFiles/lastf23.fake | sort | uniq | awk 'BEGIN { print "Users having a username that starts with \"t\""} { print }' >> Assignment3/Assignment3.txt


Task 6) Use awk on the passwd.fake file to find all users that have usernames with "a" and have UID divisible by 2
   14  awk -F: '/^a/ && $3 % 2 == 0 { print $1 }' downloadedFiles/passwd.fake | sort | awk 'BEGIN { print "Users that have the usernames starting with \"a\" and have UID divisible by 2 from passwd.fake" } { print }' >> Assignment3/Assignment3.txt


Task 7) User sed on passwd.fake to display all the distinct lines left in passwd.fake after deleting all letters, digits, and spaces
   15  sed 's/[a-zA-Z0-9[:space:]]//g' downloadedFiles/passwd.fake | uniq -u >> Assignment3/Assignment3.txt

   16  cd Assignment3/
